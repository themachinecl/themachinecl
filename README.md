# Hi! I'm Juan Paulo 👨‍💻  
A passionate Frontend Developer specialized in **Angular** and **React**, building dynamic and scalable web applications that focus on performance, usability, and clean architecture.

## My Approach 🚀  
I enjoy creating products that solve real user needs. I’ve worked across different industries, including health and banking, leading UI efforts and implementing robust design systems, reusable components, and seamless API integrations.

I'm also constantly learning — whether it’s adopting the latest Angular features like **Signals**, or improving user experience with clean React patterns and animations.
